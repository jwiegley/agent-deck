// Ownership receipts (#1873).
//
// A wrapped session can lose its tmux pane while the process tree it launched
// survives, reparented to PID 1. The pane is gone, so nothing that walks a pane
// tree or scans tmux sessions can see the survivor — and the next legitimate
// restart happily spawns a second tree against the same instance, worktree and
// conversation.
//
// The fix is a receipt written AT SPAWN: the pid of the pane's initial process
// bound to its start identity, made durable before anything can die. Every
// later decision — may this restart be admitted? which processes may be
// signalled? — is answered by verifying that receipt, never by scanning for
// processes that look like ours.
//
// This file is the session-layer wiring; internal/procowner holds the contract
// and the platform verification.

// ownershipAttribution* bound the descendant-attribution pass that runs during
// the spawn window.
//
// Fast at first, then relaxed: a wrapper that forks a child and exits does so
// within milliseconds, and a descendant can only be attributed while its
// ancestry back to the verified leader is still intact. After the first
// seconds, attribution is just keeping up with a normally-behaving session, so
// the cheaper cadence is enough. The pass stops at the fast-death window, which
// is where "this spawn is still starting" ends.

//
// A spawn that cannot be given a receipt is still a spawn, and what this must

//
//   - the pane pid cannot be read AND tmux answers, definitively, that the
//     session is gone (the pane died before this ran): nothing is written, as
//     for a gone leader below. "Definitively" means a tmux client that ran to
//     completion and said so; a probe that timed out, hit a protocol
//     mismatch, or could not launch a client is NOT absence.
//   - the pane pid cannot be read while the session exists OR its existence
//     cannot be determined: a fail-closed marker with pid 0. A tree that may
//     be running and cannot be accounted for is refused, not assumed dead.
//   - the pane process is already gone (ErrNoProcess): nothing is written. The
//     leader is verifiably dead; anything it forked and detached before this
//     point is not attributable to a PID+start-time receipt (see
//     TestIssue1873_ChildThatDetachesBeforeAttributionIsNeverClaimed), and the
//     ruling is to leave the unknowable alone. It is logged as a lifecycle
//     event so the operator can see the spawn went unclaimed.
//   - no start-identity provider (ErrUnsupported): nothing is written; the
//     platform owns nothing, by design.
//   - anything else — the identity or boot id could not be read for a LIVE
//     pane process: a fail-closed marker is written instead of a receipt. It
//     owns nothing and can never be signalled, but it refuses the next spawn
//     until the operator resolves it, because a tree we launched and cannot
//     account for is exactly what duplicates.
//
// One window remains open and cannot be closed from here: agent-deck dying
// between tmux starting the pane and this function committing the receipt. The
// process exists before the receipt can name it — that ordering is forced by
// the kernel, not chosen — so a crash inside those few milliseconds leaves a
// pane agent-deck does not know it owns. It is orders of magnitude narrower
